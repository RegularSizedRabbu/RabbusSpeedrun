# Regular Sized Speedrun
Originally Developed by Floliroy as Speedrun but maintenance has stopped since Blackwood Chapter.

Currently the version features the following improvements over the original:
- Dreadsail Reef Trial Support
- Sanity's Edge Trial Support
- Lucent Citadel Trial Support

Current Issues:
- Scoring may be completely off for these trials.
- Boss timing may or may not work, especially for Lucent Citadel.

Future Work:
- Add support for all basegame/dlc dungeons
- Improve UI appearance (specifically resolve Window clipping)
- Track best scores as well as best times
